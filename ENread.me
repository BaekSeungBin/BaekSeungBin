<h1>🐣 Hi there! I'm Seungbin Baek 👋</h1>

<p>🌱 I'm currently majoring in Computer Science at Yeungnam University.  
I hope to become either a <strong>game developer</strong> or a web developer!</p>
<p>🎮 Right now, I’ve only planned out the concept and genre of the game I want to make.</p>
<p>🎧 Since games are a form of comprehensive art, I’ve also started learning a bit about music and art to get the feel. 🎨</p>
<p>💡 My goal is to become a developer who can think and decide independently.</p>
